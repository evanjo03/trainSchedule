# Train Scheduler

 
The application made use of dynamic jQuery buttons and elements, but focused primarily on the use of Google's software platform, Firebase.  I used Firebase real-time database to store train data, and used moment.js to manipulate relative departure times based on what the user entered.

Moment.js was initially quite difficult to understand how to use effectively, but luckily is very well-documented!
